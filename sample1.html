       Many teens think there are no consequences for smoking weed.If we as a nation come together and provide help for these kids and teen.This is how most people in the U.S think and feel when they hear about kids smoking.  Together as a community we can stop the abuse of marijuana,  and not just in our city, but, world wide.Teens that smoke make bad choices,do bad in school or dropout,and disrespect their parents.
In the text herb.com it states”out of every 10 teens that smoke 4 get addicted and turn into everyday users”. That means out of 100 teens 40% smoke weed everyday. That is a lot of kids per day.  Some might says that  it is not a big deal. If doctors can use it for medicine we can use it too. But facts show from caron.org that at least 5 teens world wide get influenced a day to use drugs. In www.herb.com it states”Teens have  50% chances of a DWI after the use of Marijuana. This means that after they smoke, teens can't make good choices.  They just do first thing that pops in their minds ,and 9 times out of 10 it's not a good choice.
  Marijuana affects every part of your body. In phoenixhouse.org it stated “That teens 12-18 that smoke a great deal of marijuana it affects every part of the body the brain learning etc”. So teens that smoke have a 40% chance of getting held back or failing the grade all in all.This leads to poor judgment, laziness, and some cases deep depression.In other cases it makes teens lose brain cells witch makes them unsure of things and  lost of memory. Marijuana affects the lungs and heart in many ways. It can make your lungs black and give you breathing defects.It affects lot inside your body such as your heart, if you smoke long enogh it can make a hole in your heart. If we stop sending men and women to jail for having weed and help them maybe they will stop using. If we make low cost rehabilitation places we can help those people
People are finding new ways to use weed!They are putting it into baked goods candy drinks etc. In the text .www.herb.com it stated “That kids and teens are putting weed in food and giving them out in school and getting people high without teachers knowing”. This means that teens can get high in school without smelling or smoking weed,and teacher would never know. This can cause lots of problems in school such as fights,and poor choices.
In conclusion this is how weed is affecting our world and are kids and teens.just think if this was your kid I was talking about how would you feel. So maybe if we took the time to care and to get those kids help we can make the world a better place.Just think if we really took time out of our day to care and help these kids that have drug problems we could help them.Think if you were those kids wouldn't you want help?
